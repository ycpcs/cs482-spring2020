# Deliverables

Your main task is to demonstrate the final version of your project.  The demonstration should focus on the features addressing the requirements for Milestone 4, but should also incorporate important features from previous milestones in order to give an overall assessment of what your system is capable of.  This presentation will showcase the final working, fully-integrated Radio Telescope software for an audience to include the YCAS members, the director of York County Parks, faculty members, family and friends of the Radio Telescope team members, students, alumni, and industry partners.  It will be the culminating experience of your college career.

This milestone presentation will take place on-line via Zoom.

You will need to complete the final [self/peer evaluation](PeerReview.pdf) form.  [Download the MS Word version](PeerReview.doc), fill it out, and submit in **PDF format via email to Professor Hake by the due date listed above.**

Each team is also responsible for writing a comprehensive technical report similar in scope to the final presentations and technical reports that you provided for CS 481 in the Fall.  Follow the [CS481 guidelines](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs481-fall2019-RT/assign/assign07.html).

**Use Google Docs to write the report and store it on your Google Drive.  There will be no draft report submission - your report should be complete and thoroughly proofread.  Submit the final report in PDF format via email to Professor Hake by the due date listed above.**

Each team is also responsible for creating a Team Poster in **Powerpoint** to summarize you accomplishments.  We will use those posters for future Open Houses, and other YCP and YCAS Events.  The posters will be similar in scope to the ones you created for the Fall in CS481.  **Create your poster in Powerpoint, store on your Google Drive, and submit the final poster in PDF format via email to Professor Hake by the due date listed above.**
